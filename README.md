### Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

I am a robotics master's student at the University of Pennsylvania. I received my bachelor's degree in computer science engineering (CSE) at the University of Michigan, with a second bachelor's degree in electrical and computer engineering (ECE) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. You can find a short story about me [here](https://zhihaoruan.xyz/about/). A copy of my CV can be found [on my website](https://zhihaoruan.xyz/curriculum-vitae).
